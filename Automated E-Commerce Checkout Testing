1. Introduction
E-commerce platforms require robust testing to ensure smooth functionality, especially in critical areas such as cart operations and checkout. This project implements automated testing for item addition, checkout flow, and order validation using Selenium, JIRA, and Java. The goal is to enhance quality assurance while streamlining the testing process with DevOps methodologies.

2. Objectives

To automate the testing of e-commerce cart functionalities.

To validate the checkout process and order summary.

To implement Agile testing strategies using Scrum and Kanban.

To ensure efficient defect tracking and resolution using JIRA.

3. Technologies Used

Selenium WebDriver: For UI test automation.

Java (Basic OOP Concepts): For writing test scripts.

JIRA: For bug tracking and task management.

TestNG: For test execution and reporting.

Scrum & Kanban: For Agile test management.

GitHub/Jenkins: For CI/CD pipeline integration.

4. Methodology

Project Setup in JIRA:

Create a project board in JIRA.

Define user stories and testing tasks.

Assign team roles and responsibilities.

Test Planning:

Define detailed test scenarios for cart functionality and checkout flow.

Set up sprint cycles using Scrum methodology.

Use Kanban board to track progress.

Test Development:

Implement Selenium scripts in Java to automate UI interactions.

Write test cases using TestNG.

Store test scripts in a version-controlled Git repository.

Test Execution & CI/CD Integration:
